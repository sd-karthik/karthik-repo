This chapter has presented a range of useful graph algorithms, for
undirected, directed, and weighted graphs. The algorithms presented
are fairly simple. There are many dozens more algorithms that have
been invented for related tasks, and a number of tasks for which
there is no efficient algorithm. One of these is the 'travelling
salesman' problem, where the objective is to find the minimum cost
tour in a weighted graph whereby every node is visited. The development
of graph algorithms is still a very active research area.
<P>
What key ideas should you remember from all this? First, you may,
when solving some computational problem, be able to spot that the
data can be best represented as a graph, and that solving the problem
involves analysing the graph in some way. You can then look up
graph algorithms in a major textbook (like Sedgewick) to find out if there
is a standard algorithm that fits. Second, the very basic algorithms
mentioned here are part of the basic `vocabulary' of computer scientists,
so might be referred to when people describe their system or method.
A basic familiarity with the algorithms should help in understanding
such descriptions.
