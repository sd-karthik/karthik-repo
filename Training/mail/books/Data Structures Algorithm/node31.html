<H2><A NAME="SECTION00551000000000000000">A Named Stack</A></H2>
<P>
Suppose we have defined and implemented (as a class) a stack ADT,
with operations <TT>IsEmpty</TT>, <TT>IsFull</TT>, <TT>Push</TT>, and
<TT>Pop</TT>. We'll assume it has a defined constructor,
and constructor.
<P>
Now, for some reason, we need a `named stack' ADT, which also
has a name or label associated with it. How would we create this?
Obviously all the above operations are still relevant, we
just need an additional datafield to store the name, and
a `getname' operation to access the name. We might also want
to modify the constructor so that it can take a name
as argument, e.g.,
<P>
<PRE>    namedstack s(&quot;a useful stack&quot;);</PRE>
<P>
We want the name to be of arbitrary length, so the type of the datafield
for the name should be a pointer to chars (not a fixed length array
of chars). So the basic class definition might be:
<P>
<PRE>class namedstack : public stack {
public:
   namedstack(char* name);   // constructor
   char* getname();
   ~namedstack();  // destructor
private:
   char* stkname;
};</PRE>
<P>
Note that as `stack' is a `public base class' of named stack,
all public operations of stack are available as public operations
of named stack. So you can push/pop things in named stack! If stack had been a
private base class, public operations of stack would only be
available as <EM>private</EM> operations in named stack.
<P>
The new constructor now needs defining. One possibility is the
following:
<P>
<PRE>    namedstack::namedstack(char* name)
    {
        stkname = new char[strlen(name) + 1];
        strcpy(stkname, name);
    }</PRE>
<P>
Note two things about this implementation. First, we make
stkname a <EM>copy</EM> of the name argument passed to the constructor
(rather than just pointing at the same object).
This is a good idea, in case the argument passed to it, 
goes out of scope, gets destroyed, or gets re-used
for something else, e.g.,:
<P>
<PRE>    cin &gt;&gt; name;
    namedstackptr1 = new namedstack(name);
    cin &gt;&gt; name;
    namedstackptr2 = new namedstack(name);</PRE>
<P>
[What would happen here if we <EM>didnt</EM> use strcpy in the
namedstack constructor, but rather just set <TT>stkname = name</TT>?]
<P>
Second, we dynamically assign memory here, as required, rather
than using fixed length arrays. This is a good idea as it allows
strings of aribitrary length without wastage of space. To get the
right size of memory required, we use the `strlen' function from
the string.h library. This basic pattern, of finding the length of
an existing string using strlen, asigning memory using new, and
using strcpy to copy the string into the new chunk of memory, is
very commonly used in C/C++.
<P>
Now, the `getname' function is fairly trivial:
<P>
<PRE>   char* namedstack::getname();
   {
       return stkname;
   }</PRE>
<P>
But a little more work needs doing on the destructor. Remember 
that destuctors are needed to de-allocate dynamically
allocated memory. We've used just such for stkname. We can rely on the
general `stack' destructor to do whatever is required in de-allocating
the main stack memory, but we need to, in addition, de-allocate the
memory assigned for the name. This is just:
<P>
<PRE>   namedstack~::namedstack()
   {
       delete stkname;
   }</PRE>
<P>
Note that nowhere did we have to know how stack was implemented.
It could be that stack is implemented using an array, or using
a linked list. This is an essential feature of object oriented
programming. We are able to derive new specialised classes
<EM>without knowing how the base class is implemented</EM>, just
what operations are provided for the base class.
