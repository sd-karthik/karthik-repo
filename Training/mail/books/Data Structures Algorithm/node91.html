<P>
Parsing methods can be divided into <EM>top-down</EM> methods and <EM>bottom-up</EM> 
methods. These are illustrated schematically in figure 2.2, for a tiny
grammar of English. The illustration for bottom up parsing starts with
the sentence itself, and uses the grammar rules to determine how
combinations of words can be rewritten as more abstract grammatical
categories (e.g., ``The dog'' is a noun phrase). The parse succeeds
if this rewriting process concludes with the whole sentence rewritten
to the start symbol (sentence). Top down parsing, on the other hand,
starts with this start symbol, and rewrites/expands symbols until
it finally gets down to a sequence matching the sequence being parsed.

<P>
<P>
Both top-down and bottom-up parsing are based on the idea of
repeatedly modifying a sequence of symbols (based on allowed
rewrites in the grammar rules), with the aim of getting
from a sequence consisting of just the start symbol, to our
sequence to be parsed. This can be illustrated as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Top Down

(Sentence)                       apply rule 1
(NounPhrase VerbPhrase)          apply rule 2
(Article Noun VerbPhrase)        apply rule 4
(the Noun VerbPhrase)            apply rule 5
(the dog VerbPhrase)             apply rule 3
(the dog Verb)                   apply rule 6
(the dog jumps)                  SUCCEEDS

Bottom up

(the dog jumps)                  apply rule 6
(the dog Verb)                   apply rule 3
(the dog VerbPhrase)             apply rule 5
(the Noun VerbPhrase)            apply rule 4
(Article Noun VerbPhrase)        apply rule 2
(NounPhrase VerbPhrase)          apply rule 1
(Sentence)                       SUCEEDS</PRE>
<P>
Now, of course, the grammar in the figure is a bit limited! In fact, 
it can ONLY recognise the sentence 'The dog jumps'. There are no
options or alternatives. In any real grammar there will be many
alternative structures to explore, and that's where the difficulty
in parsing arises. This is particularly a problem when parsing natural
language. For artificial languages such as programming languages
it is not so bad, but we still need ways of choosing between
alternatives. For example, if we have the rule:
<P>
<PRE>&lt;factor&gt;     ::= ( &lt;expression&gt; ) | v</PRE>
<P>
and we are doing a top-down parse, how do we know whether to rewrite
&lt;<I>factor</I>&gt;  to ( &lt;<I>expression</I>&gt; ) or to v (letter/digit). For programming
languages, it is often possible to do this by <EM>looking ahead</EM>
one character. In the above rule, if the next character in the sequence
you are parsing is '(' then the first option is correct, otherwise
it is the second option. Often, in order to make this one-char lookahead
work, the grammar must be modified into an equivalent, but easier to
process form.
