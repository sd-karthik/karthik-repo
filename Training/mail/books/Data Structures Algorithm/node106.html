<P>
One of the simplest methods, called the ``Caesar cipher'' is to encode
the message such that the Nth letter in the alphabet is
replaced by the N+Kth. (The key is jut K). So, for K=2:
<P>
<PRE>message: attack
code:    cvvcem</PRE>
<P>
However, this is pretty easy to decode: Just try the 26 possibilities
until you get one that results in a meaningful message.
<P>
A better approach is to use a key that gives a mapping from
letters of the alphabet (plus spaces) to letters that should replace them:
<P>
<PRE> abcdefghij....
zqjprtoisva...

message: a cab
code:    qzpqj</PRE>
<P>
but this is also pretty easy to break: we could use letter frequency 
information (e.g., spaces, ts and es are common) to guess at the key.
<P>
To avoid this we could use a method closer to the first,
but with a repeated key to decide on the value of K. This
is called the ``Vigenere cipher'':
<P>
<PRE>key:     abcabc
message: attack
code:    bvwben</PRE>
<P>
One can also use a method that combines these two ideas, with an offset 
depending both on a repeated key and the letter itself.
<P>
If the key is as long as the message itself (and only used once) 
then this encyption method is provably secure (called the
``vernam cipher'' or one-time pad). But there is the problem of 
distributing the key. It is only really useful in applications where
a long key can be distributed ahead of time, in order to allow
urgent messages to be safely transmitted at a later date.
<P>
For simple encryption methods it is often possible to decode
a message if you know (or can guess) part of the message.
Perhaps you know that an email message starts with a standard header
(From: ... Return-Path ..). Obviously if a simple repeated key
encryption method is used, with a short key, then this would
allow someone to break it. Speech signals often have large
areas of silence. This too may be used to find the key.
<P>
Many encryption methods involve ``generating'' a long key 
from a shorter key. So, rather than just
repeating a short key, we have some cunning method for creating
a longer key out of the shorter one, that creates a ``pseudo-key''
that is hard to break, even if some plaintext is known.
<P>
If you don't know any of the plaintext, breaking the code
will be harder whatever encryption method: 
possible strategies are brute force methods
(try all keys until one produces something with dictionary words in),
and statistical methods (use knowledge of letter/word frequencies).
However, these strategies will also tend to be foxed if a long pseudo
key has been generated.
