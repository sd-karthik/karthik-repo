<P>
Suppose you have defined a class MyType, and, say, xptr is a pointer to an
object of type MyType, and memory has been allocated for an object of
type MyType:
<P>
<PRE>MyType* xptr = new MyType;</PRE>
<P>
Assume that objects of MyType have two datafields str and s. str is a pointer
to char; s is an integer (maybe representing the size of the string).
<P>
<PRE>int s;
char* str;</PRE>
<P>
We automatically allocate space for s and str by invoking new, but NOT
for what str points to (just for the pointer itself). Space for
what str points to will only be allocated if that is done explicitly in
the constructor. Let's further suppose the constructor results in space
for a large block of chars being assigned:
<P>
<PRE>MyType::MyType(int n)
{
  str = new char[n];
  s = n;
}</PRE>
<P>
A bit later we've finished with the object and want to get rid of it.
So we call:
<P>
<PRE>delete xptr;</PRE>
<P>
This results in the space allocated for str and s being de-allocated.
But the space we allocated that str points to is not de-allocated.
Only the immediate contents of the private datafields.
We end up with a large block of memory that is not pointed to
by anything. To get rid of the unwanted block of chars we need
a destructor:
<P>
<PRE>MyType::~MyType()
{
  delete str;
}</PRE>
<P>
If we have that, when we call <TT>delete xptr</TT> then the block
allocated for the string will be removed too.
<P>
Now, you might think that this is not too vital if we rarely
want to explicitly delete things of type MyType, but 
suppose we have a function which has an object of MyType as a local
var:
<P>
<PRE>myfn()
{
   MyType st;
   ....
}</PRE>
<P>
When st is created, memory is allocated. When the function exits,
we want it thrown away (as it was a local variable). But UNLESS
we have defined a destructor, the memory pointed to by
datafields won't be de-allocated!
<P>
In the above example, the detructor was quite simple. For linked
lists it will be a touch more complex. For a linked-list based
stack something like:
<P>
<PRE>  mylist::~mylist()
  {
    while(! empty())
       pop();
  }</PRE>
<P>
(assuming pop de-allocates memory).
