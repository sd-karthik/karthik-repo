We'll start with looking at a class of useful algorithms, 
used in many practical
applications: string processing algorithms. These include:
<P>
<UL><LI> Simple searching algorithms, useful for applications such as
text editors and retrieval tools, where the user may want to search through
some large document or collection of documents for the occurence of a given
term.<LI> Pattern matching algorithms, where the user, rather than specifying
a literal string to search for, may want just to enter a patten, such
as <TT>'?cat *'</TT> (which, assuming a fairly standard representation of
such patterns, matches all strings that end in cat, followed by
zero or more spaces).<LI> Parsers, used both in the interpretation of computer programs
and natural language. Here, the goal is to analyse a string given
a <EM>grammar</EM> representing acceptable forms, and to decompose them
into a structure suitable for further processing.<LI> File compression algorithms, used in programs such as
gzip and compress, which allow files to be stored in less space.<LI> Encryption algorithms, particularly important now for
secure transactions over the network. (These get complex very quickly, so
we'll only introduce the main ideas).
</UL>
<P>
You might want to know about these algorithms for all the reasons
listed in chapter 1: they give the basic ideas that will allow
you do develop better string processing algorithms of your own
(e.g., perhaps you want an algorithm to score two strings according
to some somplex notion of closeness of match); they are useful in
wide variety of programming tasks; they provide the basis for
understanding existing tools (e.g., encryption and compression tools);
and some of them are surprisingly neat and simple, and interesting in
their own right.
