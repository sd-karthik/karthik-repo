<P>
Although the above algorithm is quite cunning, it doesnt help that
much unless the strings you are searching involve alot of repeated
patterns. It'll still require you to go all along the document (s1) 
to be searched 
in. For most text editor type applications, the average case complexity is
little better than the naive algorithm (O(N), where N is the length of s1).
(The worst case for the KMP is N+M comparisons - much better than naive, so it's
useful in certain cases).
<P>
The Boyer-Moore algorithm is significantly better, and works by
searching the target string s2 from right to left, while moving it
left to right along s1.
The following example illustrates the general idea:
<P>
<PRE>'the caterpillar'    Match fails:
'pill'               There's no space (' ') in the search string, so move it
    ^                right along 4 places

'the caterpillar'   Match fails. There's no e either, so move along 4
    'pill'
        ^

'the caterpillar'    'l' matches, so  continue trying to match right to left
        'pill'
            ^

'the caterpillar'    Match fails. But there's an 'i' in 'pill' so move along
        'pill'       to position where the 'i's line up.
           ^
'the caterpillar'    Matches, as do all the rest..
         'pill'
             ^</PRE>
<P>
This still only requires knowledge of the second string, but we
require an array containing an indication, for each possible
character that may occur, where it occurs in the search string 
and hence how much to move along. 
So, index['p']=0, index['i']=1, index['l'] = 3 (index the rightmost 'l' where
repetitions) but index['r']=-1 (let the value be -1 for all
characters not in the string). When a match fails
at a position i in the document, at a character C we move along the 
search string to a position where the current character in the
document is above the index[C]th character in the string (which we
know is a C), and start matching again at the right hand end of the string.
(This is only done when this actually results in the string being
moved right - otherwise the string is just moved up one place, and
the search started again from the right hand end.)
<P>
The Boyer-Moore algorithm in fact combines this method of skipping
over characters with a method similar to the KMP algorithm (useful
to improve efficiency after you've partially matched a string).
However, we'll just assume the simpler version that skips based on
the position of a character in the search string.
<P>
It should be reasonably clear that, if it is normally the case that
a given letter doesnt appear at all in the search string, then this
algorithm only requires approx N/M character comparisons 
(N=length(s1), M=length(s2)) - a big improvement on the KMP algorithm,
which still requires N. However, if this is not the case then
we may need up to N+M comparisons again (with the full version of the
algorithm). Fortunately, for many applications
we get close to the N/M performance. If the search string is very
large, then it is likely that a given character WILL appear in it, but
we still get a good improvement compared with the other algorithms
(approx N*2/alphabet_size if characters are randomly distributed in a string).
