In this section we've considered various types of graph: directed vs 
undirected; labelled vs unlabelled; weighted vs not weighted.
How could we exploit inheritance and OOP to define these abstract
datatypes? There are two approaches you might take. One would be
to start with a very minimal (say, directed, unlabelled, unweighted)
graph ADT and create derived classes to define the more complex
graph types (analogous to the ``named stack'' example). These
derived types could have additional datafields (e.g., for labels)
and could, where necessary, override some of the basic graph
ADTs methods (e.g., to make a directed graph into an undirected one).
Multiple inheritance could even be used to create, say, labelled
undirected graphs.
<P>
The second approach (illustrated in the ``stack from list'' example
in the OOP section) would be to create a graph ADT that has
all possible operations and datafields (labels, weights,
methods to modify weights and labels etc) and directed edges.
This could be made a <EM>private</EM> base class for more
specialised graph types, such as a labelled undirected non-weighted
graph, which would define its operations using the operations
defined for the supporting base class. This might provide a better
basis for defining the more complex graph types, but would
be inefficient for the simple ones, as simple things would be
defined in terms of a complex underlying class definition.
