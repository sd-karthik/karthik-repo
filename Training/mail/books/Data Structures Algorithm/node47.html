<P>
OOP has the following advantages over conventional approaches:
<P>
<UL><LI> Provides a clear <EM>modular</EM> structure for programs. This makes it
good for defining abstract datatypes, where implementation details
are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface.<LI> Provides a good framework for code libraries, where supplied software
components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This
is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.<LI> Makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code, as new objects
can be created with small differences to existing ones.
</UL>
<P>
However, there is a slight cost in terms of efficiency. As objects
are normally referenced by pointers, with memory allocated dynamically,
there is a small space ovearhead to store the pointers, and a small
speed overhead to find space on the heap (at run-time) to store the
objects. For dynamic methods there is an additional small time penalty,
as the method to choose is found at run time, by searching through
the object hierarchy (using the class precedence list for the object).
These days, these efficiency penalties seem to be of relatively little
importance compared with the software engineering benefits.
