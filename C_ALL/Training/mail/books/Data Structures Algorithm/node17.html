<P>
Object-oriented programming is one of a number of approaches to programming
and programming languages:
<P>
<UL><LI> Imperative Programming (e.g., standard Pascal or C). 
A program is thought of as a sequence of
instructions, normally organised in a structured manner using
procedures, functions. Running a program involves going through
the sequence of instructions.<LI> Functional Programming (e.g., ML, Lisp). 
A program is a set of function definitions.
Running a program involves calling a function with some arguments to get
a result.<LI> Logic Programming. A program is a set of statements in some logic.
Running a program involves giving the system a fact to prove.<LI> Object Oriented Programming. A program is seen as a set of
objects which exchange information with each other. Running a program involves
sending a 'message' to an object.
</UL>
<P>
It is important to be aware of these different approaches to programming.
A given programming language typically supports more than one paradigm,
and it is to some extent up to the programmer what style of programming
they adopt even in a given language. For different problems, different
approaches are more natural, so there is no panacaea. However,
imperative and object oriented approaches are arguably the most important,
and widely applicable.
<P>
C++ supports both imperative and 
object-oriented programming. You can write C++ programs which
don't exploit its object oriented features, however very often there
will be a cleaner solution that uses objects.
