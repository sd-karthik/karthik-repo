Many real-life problems can be formulated in terms of sets of
objects and relationships or connections between objects. Examples
include:
<P>
<UL><LI> Finding routes between cities: the objects could be towns, and
the connections could be road/rail links.<LI> Deciding what first year courses to take: the objects are
courses, and the relationships are prerequisite and corequisite
relations. Similarly, planning a course: the objects are topics,
and the relations are prerequisites between topics (you have
to understand topic X before topic Y will make sense).<LI> Planning a project: the objects are tasks, and relations
are relationships between tasks.<LI> Finding out whether two points in an electrical circuit are
connected: the objects are electrical components and the connections
are wires.<LI> Deciding on a move in a game: the objects are board states, and
the connections correspond to possible moves.
</UL>
<P>
A graph is just a datastructure that consists of a set of <EM>vertices</EM>
(or <EM>nodes</EM>) 
(which can represent objects), and a set of <EM>edges</EM> linking
vertices (which can represent relationships between the objects).
A <EM>tree</EM> (met in DS&amp;A 1) is a special kind of graph (with certain
restrictions).
Graph algorithms operate on a graph datastructure, and allow us to, for
example, <EM>
search</EM> a graph for a path between two given nodes; find the <EM>shortest path</EM> between
two nodes; or <EM>order</EM> the vertices in the graph is a particular
way. These very general algorithms can then be used to solve problems
of the kind mentioned above, where the data is represented as a graph.
For example, search algorithms can be used find a possible winning
move in a game; shortest path algorithms can be used to find the
shortest route between two cities; ordering algorithms can be used to
find a possible sequence of courses to take, given prerequisite relationships
between them.
