<P>
For many applications it is useful if edges in a graph can be labelled
with a <EM>weight</EM>. For example, we could have a graph representing
possible routes between cities, where the weight might be the distance
along a given route. In other applications the weight might represent
the time taken to traverse an edge (e.g., time to get from one
city to another, or to do some task), or the <EM>cost</EM> of traversing
an edge (e.g., the cost of taking some action corresponding to an edge).
<P>
Such a graph is referred to as a <EM>weighted</EM> graph. A weighted graph
is generally implemented using an adjacency matrix: whereas before the
matrix was an NxN array of booleans, now we use an NxN array of integers or
reals, where the number indicates the weight of an edge (where there
is no edge between two nodes this corresponds in principle with a weight of
infinity, but some convention can be adopted for what to put in the matrix
for such cases). The ADT definition would be much as before, but
with further operations to modify and access weights.
<P>
Given a weighted graph, we may want to find the <EM>shortest path</EM> between
two nodes, where the 'length' of the path is just defined as the sum of
the weights on the relevant edges. This might be used to, say: find
the shortest route between cities; the quickest train journey; the cheapest
way to do a sequence of tasks.
<P>
If the weights on every edge are the same (e.g., a weight of 1) then
we already have an algorithm that will do the trick: Breadth first search.
This always explores paths of length N before paths of length N+1, and
so will find the shortest path first.
<P>
For arbitrary weights, things are a little more complex (at least, if
we want to do the task reasonably efficiently). It is necessary
to keep track, as we search, of the shortest distance we have found so
far connecting the start node to each other node. This information
can be kept in an array (say, called shortest). Then, as we search,
given a number of possible nodes to explore, the one that is
the shortest distance from the start node is explored first. (This
is like breadth first, but it is kind of 'shortest' first). If we
do this we find that when we find the target node, the path
we have effectively traversed is guaranteed to be the shortest.
<P>
I'll go through how this works with an example.
Suppose we are searching the graph in the figure, in order to find the
shortest path from node 1 to node 5. We'll use a set W to denote the
nodes so far examined. We could have alternatively used an
array ``visited'' like we used in the search algorithms. That
implicitly represented a set (all the nodes such as visited[n] = 1
are in the set).

<P>
<PRE>W={1}</PRE>
<P>
We then look at the nodes connected to 1, and record the shortest
distance from node 1 to these nodes, ie:
<P>
<PRE>shortest[2] = 3; shortest[6]=5</PRE>
<P>
The one with the shortest distance is added to W, and the 'shortest'
array updated to also hold information about the nodes connected to 2:
<P>
<PRE>W = {1, 2}; shortest[3]=10</PRE>
<P>
Now, the node with the shortest distance, not already in W is 6, so this
is added, and shortest updated as before:
<P>
<PRE>W = {1, 2, 6}; shortest[4]=7</PRE>
<P>
note that we will also have discovered another path to node 3 via 6,
but the distance is 13, so more than shortest[3]=10 (added earlier). So
this path is ignored.
<P>
Now the best node not in W is 4:
<P>
<PRE>W= {1, 2, 6, 4}; shortest[5]=7+6=13</PRE>
<P>
Best is now node 3:
<P>
<PRE>W = {1, 2, 6, 4, 3}; shortest[5]=11 (overwriting old value)</PRE>
<P>
Best is now node 5, with shortest path length 11. If that's the node
we were looking for, we now know its shortest path from node 1. 
Or we could continue
to find the shortest paths for all the nodes. With a small
extension to the approach, we could have recorded the path taken,
which could be returned.
<P>
C++ doesn't have a built in `set' datatype, so to implement
the algorithm directly we'd have to define one. We'll assume that
a set datatype has been defined (using the C++ class mechanism), 
with operations `intersection',
`iselement' (is given element in given set?), `insert' 
(adds single element to set), and `union'. Small sets may
be implemented using bit operations on ordinary numbers. For
example, a set of 16 possible elements could be represented using
a single (2 byte) integer, where each bit in that integer indicates
whether a particular item is in the set. Bitwise operations (like OR
and AND) can be used to implement union and intesection.
<P>
Anyway, the actual algorithm for this is as follows. T[i][j] gives the weight
between two nodes; V is the set of all nodes.
Psuedo code is used here for conciseness.
<P>
<PRE>Initialise shortest array so shortest[i]=T[start][i]
V is set of all nodes in graph.
W = {startnode}

while(W != V)
   {
     find the vertex w in V-W at minimum distance from start-node,
        ie, where shortest[w] is lowest
     Add w to set W
     for each u in V-W
         shortest[u] = min(shortest[u], shortest[w]+T[w][u])
   }</PRE>
<P>
It is possible to <EM>prove</EM> that this algorithm (known as Dijkstra's algorithm)
works correctly.  Essentially you use <EM>induction</EM> to show that
if the shortest distances are correct for all the nodes in W at one
stage, they are still correct after you add a new node to W as specified.
