<P>
Symmetric cryptosystems have a problem: how do you transport the secret 
key from the sender to the
recipient securely and in a tamperproof fashion? If you could send the 
secret key securely, you wouldn't
need the symmetric cryptosystem in the first place (because you would 
simply use that same secure
channel to send your message). Frequently, trusted couriers are used 
as a solution to this problem.
Another, more efficient and reliable solution is a public key cryptosystem.
<P>
In a public key system, different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt.
The receiver has a <EM>private key</EM> that can be used to
decode any message encoded using his <EM>public key</EM>. But the
public key is NOT enough to decode the message. To send a message
to someone, you look up their public key (which is, as you might
expect, quite public), encode your message with it, and sent it.
The receiver can decode it using his private key. We can express
this semi-formally as follows. If P(M) is the encoding of M using the
public key, S(M) is the decoding using the private key, we want a
system where S(P(M))=M (for all M), but where S cannot be (easily)
derived from P.
<P>
A method that enables this is RSA public-key encryption.
Here, the public and private keys are just pairs of BIG numbers. Let
the public key be (N, p) and the private key (N, s).
The plain text is broken up and translated into numbers (by whatever method),
then encryption is just:  <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2872" SRC="img15.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img15.gif"  > , decryption  <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2874" SRC="img16.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img16.gif"  > .
For this to work we want keys such that  <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2876" SRC="img17.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img17.gif"  >  (and
such that S cant be derived easily from P). It turns out that
if we generate 3 random prime numbers x,y,and z, make S be the largest
(say z), N the product of x and y, and P a number such that
PS mod (X-1)(Y-1)=1, then we have suitable keys. (You can try this
out with small primes, but really we'd use prime numbers with hundreds of
digits!). Finding suitable keys (and trying to break codes!) using this
system requires number theory algorithms, such as algorithms for
finding greatest common divisors, large primes, prime factors etc.
<P>
Encryption and decryption using this method is relatively time
consuming, compared with other methods. It is therefore
common to effectively use public key encryption just to
encode a <EM>session key</EM> to be passed with the message to the receiver, and
to encode the message itself using simpler methods (using the session
key).
<P>
Netscape (a WWW browser) uses RSA public-key encryption to encode
session keys that are then used in less costly symmetric encryption
algorithms. If, say, a bookstore wanted to setup so that people
could securely send orders which included their credit card
details and address, they would get hold of suitable public
and private keys, then tell their customers their public key
(or rather, incorporate the key in the electronic order form so that it is 
automatically used at the client end to encode messages sent with 
forms from the server). Now, if a client sends a message using that
public key, that message can (in principle) only be read by
the bookstore, so it is only the store which has the credit card
details.
