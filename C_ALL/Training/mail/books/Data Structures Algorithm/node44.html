Another thing required by almost all applications these days is a nice
graphical user interface (GUI). This is regarded as so important that most
professional programming environments provide some kind of interface toolkit.
Anyway, an interface toolkit will normally provide
a library of user interface objects, and some kind of pallette/menu
through which the user can select the interface objects they want and
arrange them in a new window. The figure below gives the general idea.
The left hand box contains a selection of user interface objects: some text,
a clickable `radio button', a check box (with text), a scroll bar, and a button. The `programmer' can pick these up with their mouse, move them into the
other window (right box), and change their attributes (e.g., the text that
goes with them; what procedure to call when a button is pressed).
As selecting some of the interface objects will result in code being
run (e.g., procedure called when button pressed), 
the interface can be easily linked in with the main program.
<P>
Generally the interface objects themselves are defined as object classes.
This provides advantages for the developer of the interface toolkit,
as inheritance can be exploited both to simply the programming and
also (as an added extra) encourage some uniformity between different
user interface objects. Typically user interface objects such
as buttons and check boxes (as illustrated above) are subclasses of
the class of `dialog item'. All dialog items share the code concerning
how they are positioned in a window, sized, have colour set, and so on.
A particular dialog item (e.g., button) will have additional data fields
(e.g., the procedure to call) and special display/draw methods.

Dialog items themselves are often a subclass of a a more general class,
which might include (among its subclasses) the class of windows.
A window, like buttons and things, can be positioned, has a particular
text font, and so on. It also needs special code to allow windows to
be opened and closed, to be brought to the front, iconified, etc.
A particular toolkit might also provide special purpose subclasses
for, say, a text window or a graphics window.
<P>
Although these different user interface objects are defined as classes,
using inheritance, a naive user of a given toolkit may only be vaguely
of the class hierarchy, just selecting options from a menu/pallette to
create their application interface. However, a more sophisticated
applications programmer would probably want to get under the surface a bit,
and be able to create special purpose subclasses with slightly different
behaviour to the that provided in the toolkit/library. The underlying OO
implementation of the interface objects should make that easy.
