Why should you want to know about algorithms?
There are a number of possible reasons:
<P>
<UL><LI> To avoid re-inventing the wheel. As you might expect, for
many programming problems, someone has already developed a good algorithm
to solve that problem. For many of these algorithms, people
have formally analysed their properties, so you can be
confident in their correctness and efficiency.
For example, we know that merge sort and quick sort both work correctly, 
and have average case complexity O(n log n), so we can straightforwardly 
use either algorithm in our programs. We might be able to further choose
between these two algorithms, depending on properties of our data
(is it already almost sorted?).<LI> To help when developing your own algorithms. Many of the
principles of data-abstraction and algorithm design, illustrated
by some of the algorithms discussed here, are important in
all programming problem. Not all tasks have ``off-the-shelf''
algorithms available, so you will sometimes have to develop your own.
Merge sort illustrates a widely applicable technique: split the problem in two,
solve each separately, then combine the results. A knowledge of well
known algorithms will provide a source of ideas that may be applied to 
new tasks.<LI> To help understand tools that use particular algorithms, so you
can select the appropriate tool to use. For example, documentation of
various compression programs will tell you that pack uses
Huffman coding, compress uses LZW, and Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm.
If you have at least some understanding of these algorithms you
will know which is likely to be better and how much reduction in
file size you might expect for a given type of file (e.g., does the
file involve a lot of repetition of common sequences of characters).<LI> Because they're neat. Many surprisingly 
simple and elegant algorithms have been invented. If you have even
a slightly Mathematical disposition you should find them interesting
in their own right.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
For all these reasons it is useful to have a broad familiarity with
a range of algorithms, and to know what they may be used for.
