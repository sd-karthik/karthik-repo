<P>
All the compression methods discussed so far are <EM>lossless</EM>,
which means that you can restore an exact copy of the original.
Although vital for texts, for images <EM>lossy</EM> compression
may be acceptible, where some fine detail in the image may
be lost. JPEG is a lossy compression method for images where
very good compression may be achieved at the expense of losing
some detail in the image. JPEG is designed so that the detail lost
is normally not perceivable by the human eye.
<P>
JPEG allows you to vary the degree of ``lossiness''. If you want a
very small file size, but can put up with a slightly poor quality image,
you can set parameters appropriately.
<P>
JPEG is jolly complicated. However, there is one key idea that
is worth explaining. The basic idea is that you transform (bits of)
the image into <EM>frequency space</EM> by applying a kind of
fourier transform. Then you throw away some of the details of
the high (spatial) frequencies. The result of this is that
gradual changes are kept, but fast or abrupt changes may be lost.
(If you've never heard of
fourier transforms this probably won't make much sense, but
it would take to long to explain).
<P>
As an illustration, here's a Piglet before and after its been compressed
with JPEG with quality set very low:

 <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap2868" SRC="img13.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img13.gif"  > 
<P>
 <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap2870" SRC="img14.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img14.gif"  > 
<P>
The size of the file has been reduced by a factor of 20, but the
image quality is poor. With higher quality settings any decrease
in quality may be barely perceivable by human eye, yet the image size
may still be reduced by a factor of 5 or so.
<P>
MPEG is a lossy compression algorithm for video. Very roughly,
it uses JPEG like compression for a frame, but does uses
difference information between frames to reduce the information
needed for each frame. (Two successive frames may be
virtually identical).
<P>
Any lossy compression algorithm is useless for text. It's no
good saving your essay, only to find your compression program
has removed all the 'details'! However, typically lossy algorithms
can give greater compression than lossless methods, and for
video, audio or graphics the result may not be noticeably
poorer than the original.
