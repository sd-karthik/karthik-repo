<P>
Now, let us suppose we want to start with some (rather more
sophisticated) set of classes for various shapes, and
develop a drawing package based
on the shape objects. We want the user to be able to select
from a menu of shapes, then position the selected shape, and
adjust its size and colour. We want the details of
the displayed shapes to be stored in an array, so we could
in principle redisplay, print, or generally manipulate them.
<P>
How do we declare a suitable array. We could
easily enough declare:
<P>
<PRE>square s[20];</PRE>
<P>
to give us an array s which can contain 20 squares. All 20 squares
will be initialised (size=0, col=red) so if we try:
<P>
<PRE>s[5].display();</PRE>
<P>
an appropriate description of a square will be printed out.
<P>
However, if we wanted to initialise the values by invoking the
constructors with extra arguments (discussed in the last section)
you'd have to explicitly do things like:
<P>
<PRE>  s[5].square(green, 4);</PRE>
<P>
rather than just including arguments in the array declaration somehow.
<P>
That would be OK, but another problem is that for the outlined
application you won't know in advance whether the shapes you want
are squares, or something else (circles, rectangles..). So
an array of squares isnt much good. We kind of want an array of
items that can be shapes, cicles or rectangles, so how about:
<P>
<PRE> shape s[20];</PRE>
<P>
But now, memory is allocated for shapes such that there is room
to hold the colour of each shape, but no room for anything else.
[When an instance is created, space is allocated for its
private data items]. So there's no room for, say, the size, if the
shape required is a square. We want a more <EM>dynamic</EM> way of
assigning things, so that when we know what the user wants,
the appropriate memory can be assigned for any possible shape
and their required data items.
<P>
You've guessed it. We use pointers. The following should 
create in this case pointers to 20 blue shapes:
<P>
<PRE>  shape* s[20];</PRE>
<P>
Then we can tell the system that we actually want a square
for the first item:
<P>
<PRE>  s[0] = new square;</PRE>
<P>
This is allowed because ``A pointer of a derived class object 
may be converted, without a cast operation, to a pointer to an
object of its base class.''. Which means in this case that
we can create a square, and assign it to a pointer
to a shape.
<P>
Because memory is being dynamically assigned, at run time,
and we don't have to statically declare an object to be an 
instance of a particular derived class, this means that
we could have a flexible program involving statements like:
<P>
<PRE>   if(userwants='s')
     s[n] = new square;
   else if(userwants='c')
     s[n] = new circle;</PRE>
