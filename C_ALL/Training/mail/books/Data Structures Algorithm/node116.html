The <EM>convex hull</EM> of a set of points, is really its natural boundary
or enclosure, as illustrated in the figure. It is defined to be the
smallest convex polygon enclosing all the points. (Convex has its
usual meaning. One way to describe a convex polygon is that it is one such 
that any line connecting two points within the polygon also fall within the
polygon. Another description could be one such that, if you follow
round the polygon, each line segment bends in the same (clockwise or
anticlockwise) direction.)

A function for finding a convex hull takes an array of points, and
returns a polygon (another array of points) (a subset of the points in
the first array). Sometimes it may be easier to modify the original
point array, rather than returning a new one.
<P>
The most natural algorithm for finding the convex hull is referred to
as package wrapping. Starting with some point guaranteed to be on
the hull (say, the one with smallest y coordinate), 
take a horizontal line in positive direction and sweep it
up until it hits a point. This point is guaranteed to be on the hull.
Record this point, anchor the line at this point, and continue sweeping
until another point is hit. Continue in this way until the `package' is
fully `wrapped', as illustrated.

So, how do we find the next point on the hull, assuming we have a suitable
line which is to be `wrapped' round to this point? Basically, the next
point is the one for which the angle between the current line, and
the line from the last point on the hull to the point considered, is
a minimum. (This angle is labelled theta ( <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2886" SRC="img22.gif" tppabs="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ds98/img22.gif"  > ) on the diagram).
If we have a function theta, that takes two points and returns the angle
between the associate line and the horizontal, then this results 
in the following algorithm:
<P>
<PRE>int wrap(points p[], int N)
  {
   int i, min=0, M;
   float th, v;                  // v will be current 'sweep' angle;
                                 // th will keep track of minimum angle
   for (i=1; i&lt; N; i++);
      if(p[i].y &lt; p[min].y) min = i;  // find starting point
   th = 0.0; p[N] = p[min];           // initialise 'th' and p[n]
   m := 0; finished := false;
   for (M=0; M&lt;N; M++)        // we'll be looking at the m'th point on hull
     {
       swap(points, M, min);  // Move the next point into the M'th position
                              // and vice versa}
      min = N; v = th; th = 360.0;  // set sweep angle, initialise min &amp; th
      for (i = M+1; i &lt;= N; i++)
                  // if the angle to this point is &gt; current sweep angle, 
                  // and is the lowest such angle come across, then set 
                  // it as a new min
         if ((theta(p[m],p[i]) &gt; v) &amp;&amp;
             (theta(p[m], p[i]) &lt; th))
           { min = i; th = theta(p[m], p[i]) }
      if( min==N ) return M;
     }
}</PRE>
<P>
Some steps of the above may not be obvious. As points on the hull are found,
they are swapped with an actual point in the array, so at any point the
array contains the first m points of the hull plus the rest of the points.
So that the algorithm can exit when the hull is complete, the starting
point in the hull is placed in the N'th position in the array. When the
current point on the hull just found is that one, then exit.
<P>
The algorithm should look vaguely like the sort algorithms which you
should have already met. This is not surprising, as we are basically
sorting a bunch of points according to their position around the hull.
Like other simplistic sort procedures (selection sort), this algorithm
doesnt have very good worst case complexity (N*N). Other methods
for finding convex hull can have N log N complexity, and have analogs in
other sorting methods.
