<P>
There are other string search algorithms that use different methods,
but the Boyer-Moore algorithm outlined above is the most well known,
fairly simple, and widely used. Even today, new algorithms are
being developed based on the Boyer-Moore one, but (for example) to work with
patterns rather than fixed search strings.
<P>
The best choice of algorithm (and the average case efficiency of your
algorithm) will depend on your 'alphabet size' (how many
different characters may appear in a string), and the amount
of repetition in the strings. For normal natural language text (e.g.,
an English document), the KMP algorithm gives little advantage over the
naive algorithm, but Boyer-Moore does very significantly better.
For a binary string where subsequences of the search string may
occur frequently, KMP may do quite alot better than the naive algorithm,
while Boyer-Moore may do little better than KMP.
<P>
For applications such as text retrieval, where you may be (conceptually) searching
though many text files for the occurence of a given string, approaches
that go through each file from start to end are likely to be too inefficient.
The only practical thing is to create a giant index which indicates for
each word/character sequence just which files contain this sequence (and where
in the file). You could have a large hash table, that allowed you to 
rapidly get from a given sequence to the list of files and locations.
This obviously requires alot of preprocessing of files, and a fair
amount of storage for the index/hash table. However, for any application
where many users will be searching the same (fixed) set of texts such
indexing will be worthwhile. I won't discuss details of how you'd do it
here, just point out that in such cases we would pre-process the files
to create indexes rather than searching them on-the-fly from the raw text.
