<P>
Encryption/decryption systems fit into the following framework.
The <EM>sender</EM> (of the secret message) <EM>encrypts</EM>
their message (the <EM>plaintext</EM>) 
using an encryption method and a <EM>key</EM>.
The resulting string (the <EM>cyphertext</EM>) is sent to
the <EM>receiver</EM>, who uses a matching decryption method,
and a key, to tranform the cyphertext back into the original message.
<P>
The aim is to develop encryption methods such that someone can't
work out the message given the code (cyphertext) without knowing the
key.
<P>
In practice, for many applications we might be willing to have a
system where, in principle, one could decode it without the
key, but it would be so very expensive it wouldnt be worth it.
(Internet financial applications fit this: People are
probably not going to use many computer-years of effort to
obtain credit card details which might result in a few hundred
pounds gain).
<P>
Encryption methods can be divided into <EM>symmetric</EM> and <EM>asymmetric</EM>
systems. In symmetric systems the same key is used by both the
sender and the receiver. In asymmetric systems the sender uses one
key (the <EM>public</EM>) key, and the receiver uses another (the
<EM>private</EM> key. Symmetric systems are simpler, so will be described
first, but asymmetric methods are now more important for most applications.
