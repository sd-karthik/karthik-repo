There is alot of terminology associated with graphs that needs to
be introduced. Figure ? shows examples of two graphs, illustrating
some of the main ideas:

Graphically we can think of a graph as a collection of points, some
of which are connected. These connections can be two way or one way
(illustrated by arrows, for one way connections). Graphs with one
way connections are referred to as <EM>directed</EM>. In an <EM>undirected</EM> graph, 
if there 
is a connection from vertex 1 to vertex 2, there also is from node 2 to node 1.
Directed graphs may be <EM>cyclic</EM> or <EM>acyclic</EM> depending on
whether it is possible to get back to a vertex by following arrowed
links. Two nodes are <EM>adjacent</EM> if an edge connects them, and
a <EM>path</EM> is a sequence of adjacent vertices. Graphs may be <EM>connected</EM>
or <EM>unconnected</EM> as illustrated in the figure. Vertices may be <EM>labelled</EM> as illustrated in the first example in the figure, where the labels are
just integers.
<P>
We often use family tree terminology for graphs. The <EM>children</EM> of a node
n1 are those nodes such that there is an edge from n1 to the child node.
(These are also sometimes called the <EM>neighbours</EM> of the node, particularly
when talking about general graphs rather than trees).
The <EM>parents</EM> of a node is the reverse. <EM>Ancestors</EM>, <EM>siblings</EM>
and <EM>descendants</EM> are what you might expect.
<P>
Formally, a graph G = (V, E) where V is a set of vertices, E is a set of
edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices from V. 
Definitions for paths, cycles, adjacency, connectivity etc can be stated
in terms of this formal description.
