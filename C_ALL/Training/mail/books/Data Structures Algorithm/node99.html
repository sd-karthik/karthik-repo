  The basic idea behind a substitutional compressor is to replace an 
occurrence of a particular phrase or group of bytes in a piece of data with a 
reference to a previous occurrence of that phrase.  There are two main 
classes of schemes, named after Jakob Ziv and Abraham Lempel, who first 
proposed them in 1977 and 1978.
<P>
The LZ78 family of compressors
<P>
LZ78-based schemes work by entering phrases into a *dictionary* and then, 
when a repeat occurrence of that particular phrase is found, outputting the 
dictionary index instead of the phrase. The dictionary is
constructed as the string is traversed.  New strings are only added
if they extend a current string in the dictionary. By this
means, you will tend only to get long strings in the dictionary
if they occur frequently in the text.
<P>
The LZ77 family of compressors
<P>
LZ77-based schemes keep track of the last n bytes of data seen, and when a 
phrase is encountered that has already been seen, they output a pair of 
values corresponding to the position of the phrase in the previously-seen 
buffer of data, and the length of the phrase.So, we might
replace the string 'the cat ate the dog' with 'the cat ate (1,4)dog'.
<P>
Substitutional compressors are good for strings with frequently
reoccuring subsequences. So, they are useful for text files, but
also for graphics files where a certain texture or colour may be
represented by a repeated sequence. Many popular compression
and archive programs (e.g., zip, gzip, compress) are based primarily on
substitututional methods.
