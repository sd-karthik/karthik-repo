<P>
One vital tool to support complex object oriented design and implementation
is an object browser. An object browser will display graphically
the hierarchy of objects in your compiled program (including any
in included modules).
<P>
Object browsers display obejcts in a hierarchy. Typically
you can click on any of the
objects in the hierarchy, and get information about that object. The
information would normally include the declarations for
all the objects methods and data fields,
with an indication of where they were inherited from (and perhaps further
info, such as whether they are declared <EM>virtual</EM> methods). 
If the source code was available, then by selecting one of the methods
you should be taken directly to the place in the source code where that
method is defined.
<P>
An object browser allows you to rapidly move within the text files
defining a large object oriented system. If, say, you're editing
a procedure which calls the `draw' method, and want to check out/modify
that method, you need to go straight to just that version of the
draw method that would be used there. Lets say the procedure you're editing
is class1::display. You'd find class1 in the graphical class hierarchy, select that,
find its draw method, select that, and then be at the appropriate draw
method. Simple search tools (that may allow you to search for the procedure
draw's definition) are just not adequate. There may be many versions of
draw, and ob1 may inherit its version from any of its ancestors.
<P>
Object browsers allow static browsing of the classes. However, many systems
also provide more run-time debugging tools, showing the object instances
created at run-time, their inherited methods, and their location inthe
hierarchy.
