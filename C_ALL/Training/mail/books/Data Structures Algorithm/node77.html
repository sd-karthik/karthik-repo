<P>
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm uses information about the
characters in the string you're looking for to determine how
much to `move along' that string after a mismatch occurs.
To illustrate this, consider one of the examples above: 
s1= 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab', s2 = 'aaaaa'. Using the naive algorithm you
would start off something like this:
<P>
<PRE>'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
'aaaaa'
 ^

'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
'aaaaa'
  ^

'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
'aaaaa'
   ^

'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
'aaaaa'
    ^

'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'   
'aaaaa'
     ^                  match fails, move s2 up one..

'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
 'aaaaa'
  ^

etc etc</PRE>
<P>
but in fact if we look at s2 (and the 'b' in s1 that caused the bad match)
we can tell that there is no chance that
a match starting at position 2 will work. The 'b' will end up being
matched against the 4th character in s2, which is an 'a'. Based on our
knowledge of s2, what we really want is the last iteration above replaced with:
<P>
<PRE>'aaaabaaaabaaaaab'
     'aaaaa'
      ^</PRE>
<P>
We can implement this idea quite efficiently by
associating with each element position in the searched for string
the amount that you can safely move that string forward if you get a
mismatch in that element position. For the above example..
<P>
<PRE>a 1     If mismatch in first el, just move string on 1 place.
a 2     If mismatch here, no point in trying just one place, as
        that'll involve matching with the same el (a) so move 2 places
a 3
a 4
a 5</PRE>
<P>
In fact the KMP algorithm is a little more cunning than this.
Consider the following case:
<P>
<PRE>'aaaab'   i=2,j=2
'aab'
   ^</PRE>
<P>
We can only move the second string up 1, but we KNOW that the first
character will then match, as the first two elements are identical, so
we want the next iteration to be:
<P>
<PRE>'aaaab'  i=2,j=1
 'aab'
   ^</PRE>
<P>
Note that i has not changed. It turns out that we can make things
work by never decrementing i (ie, just moving forward along s1),
but, given a mismatch, just decrementing j by the appropriate amount,
to capture the fact that we are moving s2 up a bit along s1, so the
position on s2 corresponding to i's position is lower. We can
have an array giving, for each position in s2, the position in s2
that you should backup to in s2 given a mismatch 
(while holding the position in s1 constant). We'll call this array next[j].
<P>
<PRE>j       s2[j]   next[j]
0       a       -1
1       b       0
2       a       0
3       b       1
4       b       2
5       a       0
6       a       1</PRE>
<P>
In fact next[0] is a special case. If the
first match fails we want to keep j fixed and increment i.
If we are incrementing i and j each time round the loop this
is achieved easily if next[0]=-1.
<P>
<PRE>'abababbaa'      i=4, j=4
'ababbaa'
     ^          mismatch, so j = next[j]=2

'abababbaa'      i=4, j=2
  'ababbaa'
     ^
-------------------
'abaabbaa'      i=3, j=3
'ababbaa'
    ^           mismatch, so j = next[j]= 1

'abaababbaa'      i=3, j=1
  'ababbaa'
    ^
-------------------
'bababbaa'      i=0, j=0
'ababbaa'
 ^              mismatch, so j = next[j]= -1, increment i and j.

'abaababbaa'      i=1, j=0
 'ababbaa'
  ^</PRE>
<P>
It's easy enough to implement this algorithm once you have the
next[..] array. The bit that is mildly more tricky is how to
calculate next[..] given a string. We can do this
by trying to match a string against itself. When
looking for next[j] we'd find the first index k such that
s2[0..k-1] = s2[j-k..j-1], e.g:
<P>
<PRE>'ababbaa'      s2[0..1] = s2[2..3]
  'aba....'    so next[4] = 2.
     ^</PRE>
<P>
If there is is no matching region, return 0. If j=0, return -1.
<P>
(Essentially we find next[j] by sliding forward the pattern
along itself, until we find a match of the first k characters
with the k characters before (and not including) position j).
<P>
The detailed implementations of these algorithms are left as
an exercise for the reader - it's pretty easy, so long as you
get the boundary cases right and avoid out-by-one errors.
<P>
The KMP algorithm is extremely simple once we have the
next table:
<P>
<PRE>  int i, j, M=strln(s2), N = strln(s1);
  for(i = 0, j=0; j &lt; M &amp;&amp; i &lt; N; i++, j++)
    while ((j &gt;= 0) &amp; (s1[i] != s2[j]))
       j = next[j];
  if (j == M) return i-M;
  else return -1;</PRE>
<P>
(If j = length(s1) when the loop exits we have a match and can return
something appropriate, such as the index in s1 where the match starts).
