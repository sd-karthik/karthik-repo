elated commands

cat — Output the contents of a file.
printf — Write formatted output.
tac — Output the contents of files in reverse order.
tee — Route a file's contents to multiple outputs.
touch — Update the timestamp of a file or directory.
tr — Translate one set of characters to another.
Output a string comprising the name of each file in the working directory, with each name separated by a space. For example, if you have three files in your working directory, output may resemble the following:

flower.jpg document.doc readme.txt

This command will output the three filenames, just as above, but instead of printing them to the terminal, it will pipe the output to the wc command, which will display a count of the number of words in the output; this is a quick and simple way to find out how many files are in the working directory. So if we have three files, the output of this command will be:

3
